The connection then determines its own bounding box.<br>\n * <br>\n * A connection has a simple router by default - one that can connect the source and target anchors. But additional routers\n * are available and can be set on the connection. Some routers can handle constraints for the connection. Note that when\n * setting a routing constraint on a connection, you must first set the router which will use that constraint.<br>\n * <br>\n *\n * <b>TODO:<br></b>\n * <i>\n * A convenient way to share the router with all connections and to place connections above the drawing is to use a\n * ConnectionLayer. The layer has a connection router property which it shares with every child that's a connection.\n * You can update this property and easily change every connection's router at once.\n * </i>\n * <br>\n * <br>\n * <h2>Routing and Anchors</h2>\n * A connection always has a router and it must set at least two ports on the connection: the source and target\n * endpoints. By default, or when set to null, the connection's routing will be performed by an internal default router.\n * The ends are placed with the help of {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ConnectionAnchor anchors}. An\n * {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ConnectionAnchor anchors} is a fixed or calculated location, usually associated with some\n * figure. For example, the {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ChopboxConnectionAnchor ChopboxAnchor} finds the point at which a\n * line going to the reference point intersects a box, such as the bounds of a figure. The reference point is either\n * the anchor at the opposite end, or a bendpoint or some other point nearest to the anchor.\n * <br>\n * {@img jsdoc_chopbox.gif ChopboxAnchor}\n * <br>\n * The router calculates the endpoints and any other points in the middle of the connection. It then sets the points on the\n * connection by calling {@link draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine#addPoint Polyline.addPoint}. The connection's existing point list\n * can be reused to reduce garbage, but the points must be set on the connection anyway so that it knows about any changes made.\n * <br>\n * <h2>Adding Decorations and Children to Connections</h2>\n * Like most figures, Connection supports the addition of children. The children might be a label that\n * decorate the connection. The placement of each type of decoration can vary, so a {@link draw2d.layout.locator.ConnectionLocator ConnectionLocator}\n * is used to delegate to each child's constraint object, a Locator. <br>\n * <br>\n * {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.Decorator Decorator} can be used to create and render a rotatable shape at\n * the end or start of a connection like arrows or boxes. Examples are {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.ArrowDecorator ArrowDecorator}, {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.BarDecorator BarDecorator} or {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.CircleDecorator CircleDecorator}\n * <br>\n * <h2>Connection Layout</h2>\n * Connections extend the process of validation and layout to include routing. Since layout is the process of positioning children, routing must\n * come first. This allows a child's locator to operate on the connection's newly-routed points.<br>\n * Check out [Class System Guide](#!/guide/class_system) for additional reading.\n *\n * @inheritable\n * @author Andreas Herz\n * @extends draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine\n */\n\ndraw2d.Connection = draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine.extend(\n  /** @lends draw2d.Connection.prototype */\n  {\n\n    NAME: \"draw2d.Connection\",\n\n    /**\n     * Creates a new figure element which are not assigned to any canvas.\n     *\n     * @param {Object} [attr] the configuration of the shape\n     */\n    init: function (attr, setter, getter) {\n      this.sourcePort = null\n      this.targetPort = null\n\n      this.oldPoint = null\n\n      this.sourceDecorator = null\n      /*:draw2d.ConnectionDecorator*/\n      this.targetDecorator = null\n      /*:draw2d.ConnectionDecorator*/\n\n      // decoration of the polyline\n      //\n      this.sourceDecoratorNode = null\n      this.targetDecoratorNode = null\n\n      // helper let to restore the initial visual representation if the user drag&drop\n      // the port outside of the browser window.

components vertically and\n * horizontally in a dynamic rectangular grid of cells, with each component occupying in one or more cell.\n * To define a form layout you specify the form's columns, rows. Everyhing that applies to columns applies\n * to rows too - just with a different orientation. FlexGridLayout uses the same API, algorithms and implementation\n * for column and rows.\n *\n * FlexGridLayout focuses on form-oriented panels much like the 'Segment' panel. Nevertheless, it is a general purpose\n * layout system that can be used for the vast majority of rectangular layouts.\n *\n * Define your layout with:\n * <ul>\n *  <li>[number]px</li>\n *  <li>grow</li>\n *  <li>pref</li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * e.g. we want build a shape with a border on the left and right and a label in the\n * center.
